        <h2>Welcome to the test website!</h2>
        <p>This website is designed to test the web scraper for the cybercrime detection project.</p>
        <p>Here is some text that the scraper should be able to extract. It contains some keywords that might be relevant to the project.</p>
        <article>
            <h3>Article 1: Benign Content</h3>
            <p>This is a normal article about technology. Nothing to see here. We discuss the latest in web development and how to build secure applications.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h3>Article 2: Suspicious Content</h3>
            <p>This article contains some suspicious keywords. For example, we might mention things like credit card, password, or social security number. We might also talk about how to get free access to paid services. This is a test to see if the scraper can identify and flag this content.</p>
            <p>Another paragraph with more keywords: login credentials, bank account, phishing attempt.</p>
